# JavaScript Password Generator

This is a simple JavaScript-based password generator that allows you to create strong passwords with various criteria such as length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## How it Works

1. When you click the "Generate Password" button, the script will prompt you to enter the desired password length. The password length must be between 8 and 128 characters.

2. After specifying the length, the script will then prompt you to choose the criteria for your password, including:
   - Uppercase letters
   - Lowercase letters
   - Numbers
   - Special characters

3. You must choose at least one of these criteria. If you don't, the script will keep prompting you until you make a selection.

4. Once you've specified the length and criteria, the script generates a random password based on your choices and displays it in the "Generated Password" field.

5. You can then copy the generated password and use it as needed.
